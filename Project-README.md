This project replicates the Fylo Data Storage Component design, providing a visual representation of storage usage. It consists of two primary sections:

A Fylo branding section with a logo and icons.
A storage usage section with a progress bar showing used and remaining storage.
#Features
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Progress Bar: Visually represents storage usage out of 1000 GB.
Storage Bubble: Displays the remaining storage in a speech bubble style.
Bootstrap Integration: Utilizes Bootstrap's grid and utility classes for layout and responsiveness.
Design
This design closely follows the Fylo Data Storage Component challenge, presenting a clean, modern interface. The background features a gradient design, and the storage bar includes a smooth gradient from one color to another.
